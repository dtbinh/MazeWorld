State first: the code cannot be referred.

It is a project in my first-year graduate student in Dartmouth College. I have done similar job when I am a junior undergraduate student. But with a different problem and different UI, the project still make me feel interesting. Do you like the animation?

Use A* algorithm to help a single robot, multiply robots and blind robot get to the destinations. Also implemented a UI by JAVA. Details are in report.
